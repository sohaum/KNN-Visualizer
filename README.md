# KNN Visualizer

An interactive web app to visualize K-Means clustering and Voronoi diagrams.  
Built with vanilla JavaScript, CSS, and SVG.  
Easily explore clustering, inertia, silhouette scores, and more!

## Features

- ðŸŽ¨ Add data points by clicking
- ðŸŽ¯ Drag centroids to see cluster changes
- âš¡ Keyboard shortcuts: Space (step), R (reset), G (generate)
- ðŸ“Š Toggle Voronoi diagram for cluster boundaries
- ðŸ”„ Watch inertia and silhouette scores update live

## Visual Enhancements

- Glassmorphism Design: Modern frosted glass effects with backdrop blur
- Gradient Backgrounds: Beautiful color gradients throughout the interface
- Smooth Animations: Fluid transitions for centroids and data points
- Hover Effects: Interactive button animations with shimmer effects
- Visual Feedback: Convergence indicators and statistics display

## ðŸš€ New Features

- Interactive Data Generation: Click anywhere to add new data points
- Draggable Centroids: Drag centroids to see real-time cluster changes
- Voronoi Diagrams: Toggle to visualize cluster boundaries
- Algorithm Statistics: Real-time inertia and silhouette score calculation
- Variable Animation Speed: Adjustable from very slow to very fast
- Keyboard Shortcuts: Space (step), R (reset), G (generate), I (initialize), V (voronoi)

## ðŸ“Š Advanced Functionality

- Step-by-step Execution: Watch each iteration of the algorithm
- Convergence Detection: Automatic stopping when clusters stabilize
- Smart Data Generation: Creates clustered data patterns by default
- Performance Optimization: Throttled rendering for smooth performance
- Mobile Responsive: Works great on all device sizes

## ðŸŽ¯ Interactive Elements

- Tooltips: Hover over centroids to see detailed information
- Visual Clustering: Lines connecting points to their centroids
- Convergence Feedback: Color-coded status indicators
- Helpful Hints: Contextual tips that appear periodically

## ðŸ”§ Technical Improvements

- Better Color Palette: More vibrant and distinguishable colors
- Smooth Transitions: CSS animations for all state changes
- Event Handling: Comprehensive mouse and keyboard interactions
- State Management: Clean separation of concerns
- Error Prevention: Robust input validation and boundary checking
